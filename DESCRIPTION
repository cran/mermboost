Description: Provides a novel framework to estimate mixed models via gradient 
    boosting. The implemented functions are based on the 'mboost' and 'lme4' packages, 
    and the family range is therefore determined by 'lme4'. A correction mechanism 
    for cluster-constant covariates is implemented, as well as estimation of the 
    covariance of random effects. These methods are described in 
    the accompanying publication; see <doi:10.1007/s11222-025-10612-y> for details.
